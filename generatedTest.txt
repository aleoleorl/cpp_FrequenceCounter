In the middle-of-nowhere, an old-town stood: it had an eerie silence. 
Suddenly, a cat-black as night-darted across the street. Suddenly, the wind howled. The eerie feeling grew stronger. People, people always said it was haunted. Haunted by memories-memories long forgotten. Dogs barked, barked at shadows. 
Suddenly, a figure appeared: it vanished. Darkness fell. Everyone knew, knew the tales. Whispers spread, spread like wildfire. Fear gripped, gripped tight. Then, just like that, it was gone.
